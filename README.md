# SFDQ Lab 6 – dOxygen Documentation

This repository contains the work completed for **Lab 6** of the
**Software Design & Quality (SFDQ)** module.  
The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the use of **dOxygen** for
generating software documentation from C++ source code.

The lab is divided into two parts, each focusing on a different aspect
of software documentation and design.

## Lab Overview

### Part 1 – Introduction to dOxygen
Part 1 introduces the basic use of dOxygen by documenting a simple C++
example involving inheritance. The goal is to demonstrate correct use
of dOxygen comments and generation of documentation outputs.

Detailed information for Part 1 can be found in: part1 of this repo

### Part 2 – Weather Station System Documentation
Part 2 applies dOxygen to a larger, object-oriented system based on a
Weather Station design. A UML class diagram was created and used to
generate skeleton C++ code, which was then documented using dOxygen.

Detailed information, including the UML diagram, can be found in: part2 of this repo
